# Athena-I
Athena Unit 1 is a robot that I started developing with the goal of indoor and limited outdoor driving. The objectives are to drive using two wheels mounted parallel to each other, maintain balance through MPU6050 sensor and PID control, and transmit real-time captured video to users via a server.
